Boundary Monitoring Extension
============================

This extension works only with the standalone machine agent.

## Use Case

Boundary is a consolidated operations management platform built for todayâ€™s IT environments. Delivered as a SaaS offering, Boundary enables customers to monitor their entire IT environment from a single point of control and is uniquely designed to deal with challenges of modern, highly distributed applications. The boundary-monitoring-extension gathers aggregate meter metrics exposed through Boundary's Historical Data REST API and sends them to the AppDynamics Metric Browser.

## Installation
<ol>
	<li>Type 'ant package' in the command line from the boundary-monitoring-extension directory.
	</li>
	<li>Deploy the file BoundaryMonitor.zip found in the 'dist' directory into the &lt;machineagent install dir&gt;/monitors/ directory.
	</li>
	<li>Unzip the deployed file.
	</li>
	<li>Open &lt;machineagent install dir&gt;/monitors/BoundaryMonitor/monitor.xml and configure the Boundary parameters.
<p></p>
<pre>
	&lt;argument name="api-key" is-required="true" default-value="" /&gt;          
	&lt;argument name="org-id" is-required="true" default-value="" /&gt;
</pre>
	</li>	
	<li> Restart the machine agent.
	</li>
	<li>In the AppDynamics Metric Browser, look for: Application Infrastructure Performance | &lt;Tier&gt; | Custom Metrics | Boundary
	</li>
</ol>
